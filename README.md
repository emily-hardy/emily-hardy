AV OPS ---> IT/DEV
- 🌱 I work in IT/AV support with the long term goal of working in DevOps! I have a background in tech operations (for-profit) and development (non-profit).
- 🌎 I’m looking to collaborate on community projects. If you have a community-oriented project that needs a few more ops/tech folks, I'd love to help.
- 🤔 I’m looking to build connections in the tech space. I'd love to connect.
- 💬 Ask me about some of the community projects I've taken part in. I created a student-run web-based radio station during undergrad!
