OPS >>> IT/DEV
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT to make the transition to DevOps! I have a background in operations (for-profit) and development (non-profit), and I'm excited to make the switch to tech.
- 🌎 I’m looking to collaborate on community projects. If you have a community-oriented project that needs a few more ops/tech folks, I'd love to help.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building connections in the tech space. I'd love to connect.
- 💬 Ask me about some of the community projects I've taken part in. I created a student-run internet radio station during undergrad!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a professional audio engineer and drummer. Music is my passion.
